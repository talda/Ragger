# A simple RAG Library
Introduction
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Library is a sophisticated tool designed to optimize the performance of large language models by integrating external data sources. This approach significantly enhances the model's ability to generate accurate, relevant, and contextually rich responses.

## Features
Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Leverages external data to enhance response quality of language models.
Customizable Data Sources: Flexibility to integrate various external data sources like websites, databases, and text documents.
Efficient Data Chunking: Optimizes data retrieval with effective data segmentation.
Advanced Prompt Engineering: Crafts detailed and contextual prompts for superior text generation.
Broad Application Spectrum: Ideal for complex tasks like legal research, scientific reviews, and sophisticated customer service.
